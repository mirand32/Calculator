# Calculator
Basic calculator with simple math operators.
Tried to make the calculator as crash proof as possible.
Allows for hitting equals after an operator, dividing by zero, trying to put in multiple decimals, trying to precede whole integers with zeroes etc...
Basic styling and a history of previous operations used on the right
